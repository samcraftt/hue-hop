Hue Hop is my first completed iOS app. The user attempts to memorize and return a color pattern that gradually increases in length. I used Google AdMob to monetize the app.
Please [download the app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hue-hop-memory-game/id6737150501) for free! (If you happen to be reading this soon after 10/19/2024, the app is briefly unavailable on the app store.)
